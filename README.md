# The Application of Deep Learning Technology for Reading Water Meter using CiRA CORE
The architecture of the developed model is based on YOLOv4-tiny and developed in CiRA CORE. We implemented five models: 
  1. Water meter frame detection model.
  2. Number detection model.
  3. Dial detection model.
  4. Dial pointer detection model.
  5. Water meter frame corner model.

The purpose of this project is to learning how to use CiRA CORE, design and develop water meter reading and detection, design and develop system flow, determine performance of each model and create experience in developing deep learning model.
